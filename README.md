## 🐼 Data Analysis with Pandas

This repository features multiple projects that rely heavily on **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** — the go-to Python library for data manipulation and analysis.

### 🧠 Why Pandas?
Pandas makes working with structured data fast, easy, and expressive. It provides powerful, flexible tools to:
- Clean and preprocess data
- Perform complex transformations
- Analyze trends and patterns
- Work seamlessly with CSV, Excel, SQL, and more

### 🔧 Core Pandas Features Used:
| Function/Method         | Description                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pd.read_csv()`         | Load datasets from CSV files                                |
| `df.head()`, `df.info()`| Preview and understand the data structure                   |
| `df.isnull()`, `df.dropna()` | Detect and handle missing values                     |
| `df.describe()`         | Generate summary statistics                                 |
| `df.groupby()`          | Group data and apply aggregate functions                    |
| `df.sort_values()`      | Sort data based on columns                                  |
| `df.value_counts()`     | Count unique occurrences of values                          |
| `df.apply()` + `lambda` | Apply custom functions to columns or rows                   |
| `df.merge()` / `df.join()` | Combine multiple datasets                             |
| `df.loc[]`, `df.iloc[]` | Access specific rows and columns by label or position       |

### 📁 Projects That Use Pandas:
- **IMDB Movie Analysis** – Data cleaning, sorting top movies, genre analysis.
- **Football Stats Dashboard** – Team performance trends, win/loss records.
- **COVID-19 Tracker** – Time-series analysis and country-wise breakdowns.

> Whether it's cleaning messy data or digging deep into insights, **Pandas is at the core** of every data-driven project in this repository.
